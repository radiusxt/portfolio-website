# Overview

Built with Next.js and TypeScript together, the website produces a fast, modular and scalable foundation for showcasing my skills in both software development & photography. The interface is designed using an open-source framework, Once UI, known for its minimal, dynamic and futuristic user experience across desktop and mobile devices.

# Key Objectives

- Design
  - Designed a minimal and dynamic background with toggle option for light/dark mode.
  - Selected a simple, accessible and cohesive colour palette [black, white, blue].
- Engineering
  - Learned how to build a modern website using TypeScript and Next.js based on my previous knowledge in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
  - Integrated APIs for email delivery with syntax and semantic validation.
  - Built several modular, client-side components and correctly managed their state.
- AI-assisted Workflows
  - Leveraged Gemini, Claude Code & ChatGPT to assist in producing useful code (not AI slop) for new features and debugging issues.

# Tech Stack

- TypeScript
  - Enforcing strict type safety standards for components, data and functions to catch errors at build time rather than production.
  - Refactoring unused components with better scalability for increased data.
  - Robust architecture heavily prioritises a well-structured, maintainable codebase with organised filesystem-based routing.
- Next.js + Once UI
  - Customising component layout on dynamic webpages.
  - Incorporating animations and transitions on entrance into static elements for a smoother feel.
- React
  - Managing state for client-side components on text fields, scrolling, clicking, etc.
- HTML + SCSS
  - Creating styles designed for mobile and desktop devices for their display sizes.
  - Managing styles on orientation dynamically using design tokens.
- Resend + Emailable
  - Handling email address syntax and verification.
- Markdown + JSX
  - Writing project content and tracking website features.
- Vercel
  - Hosts the website with a zero-configuration, high-performing edge network, providing a smooth user experience.
  - Supports both frontend and server-side processing.
- GitHub
  - Version control for managing project structure.
  - Commit messages aligning with industry standards. See [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

# Challenges & Insights

Without prior experience in TypeScript, building a website with Next.js presents a compelling challenge in balancing strict architectural patterns with creative flexibility. One of the primary insights is the necessity of mastering server components. While they offer significant performance gains by reducing client-side JavaScript, they require a disciplined approach to state management when integrating interactive UI elements. Fortunately, AI-assisted/agentic coding has become strong enough where it can produce high quality code when the given prompt is detailed and concise. This freed up time to focus less on the technical side and to think more creatively about layout, styling, colours and accessibility. The Once UI framework transforms the development experience, ensuring design tokens and component props remain consistent across the entire application. It's 'smarter' versions of regular HTML components such as Flex, Row and Heading make positioning and customisation require less code for faster production. The final result is a highly maintainable, scalable codebase bridging the gap between high-fidelity design concepts to deployment-ready products.

# Outcomes

Building this website has allowed me to demonstrate my ability to leverage AI-assisted workflows on building something I use on a frequent basis. The website thoroughly organises and displays my work to recruiters and potential clients in the future.
